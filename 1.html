            <h1>Crucible</h1>
            <h3>Engine</h3>

            <p>Crucible is all about providing helpful components and tools to developers with my own needs and wants for my workflow.</p>

            <p>
              <br>
              History:
              <br>
            </p>



            <p>We start back into about the year 2017, I decided I wanted to try making an engine.
              Usually every game devs mistake when they intend to just make a game.
            </p>
            <p>Well I was moviated enough not to just make a game, but I wanted to learn how engine's worked.
              Develop my own understanding of the basis of a game engine that we take for granted every day as a game developer.
              So at the time I had a mac book 2010 I worked on, The end result was me having learned to make a 3d engine using open GL.
              I learned how to import obj's, render them, and apply texture's with shader's and binding them to a slot.
              Did fog, then to terrain, I ended up becoming burnt out from all the learning, and motivation had died down. How ever I added in terrain masking before doing so, and adding a height map for it.

              It was called prime.

            </p>

            <p>
              The next version I had dumped 3d entirly and started to learn and work on a OpenGL RPG game.
              This did not go that far, but I had moving sprites and basic 2d collison checking with tiles.
              I called this one RPG0
            </p>

            <p>
              Fast forward to 2021/2022 after I had went into other area's of intrest such as PCB design and 3d printing.
              I have once again became intrested in working on my own engine again.
              I have always wanted engine with a familir enough environment when I work in the source engine by valve.
              This is what my intial goal was, and well to a certain extend still is.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2022 I started help working on a project named Copper-source by a user named kleadron.
              The intent here was to create Gold source like engine with more modern C#, I implemented a basic Enity Component System.
              It then moved into a Quake 3 way instead of gold src era.
              This was due to more flexable brush work was able to be done than what gold src could do.
              Some feature's the original had already, wad reading support, leaf support, reading compiled Hl1 and alpha bsp's. hacky fake glass rendering.
            </p>
              Kleadron has since moved on with a newer private project with redone code. As Copper-Source was the first attempt.

            <p>
              <br>
              --More Current--
            </p>
              <br>
              It started out me refreshing with OpenGL created a more complex engine and framework with working IK, and a Entity Compoent System.
              This crude first iteration, but functional was called Crimengine-pc.
              The reason behind this name was Orginally a user named Crimester, He was attempting to create a PSX engine called Crimengine and so thats where -pc came from.
              He was creating it in C, with all that comes with C, pain.
              PSX debugging is also not as developer friendly.


              <p>
              He moved on eventually with a new project aimed at it.
              </p>
              <br>
              --Version 2--
              <p>
              <br>
              This was called CrimEngine-Dx11.
              I started working on converting The Engine base to compile and work on Visual Studio with DirectX11.
              The original project was working in Dev C++ with mingw.(wasn't my choice)

              As I had no other choice to do so because mingw was giving problems related to templates and had to start doing dumb hacks to make it compile.
              I was just fed up with it at this point and decided to move it over to Visual Studio and go to DirectX11 Because i no longer wanted to support OpenGL.

              I was scucessful but being a technical artist was not my strong suit.

              So I decided to go with Wicked-engine's rendering system and job system as my new Basis.

              I didn't want to deal with that sort of framework anymore from scratch as I had implemented at this point three Rendering API's and each time I disliked it that much more.
            </p>
              <p>
              <br>
              --Version 3--
              <br>
              </p>
              This is now the current version, it has had a name change to Crucible currently, and uses a mish mash of wicked-engine code with various third-party library's
              Including but not limited to Mono-C#, OpenFBX, and Soon Webm, and FMOD.
